# Planning

## 1. Project Idea

### 1.1. Highlights

- Based on Project Requirements, Common Interest, and Instructor
  Recommendations.
- Fast-Access to Music: Top Ten, Artist, Track(song), and Lyrics.

- Easy to use with dropdown selection with Search box.

- Dynamic Results based on the userâ€™s specified search.

### 1.2. Planning Summary

The development team agreed on a Music app that provides fast access to details on their favorite music. The app would provide detailed music information: track, lyrics, album, and artist categories.

A wireframe showing a dropdown box, text search input field, and space to render results was created. The team tested multiple APIs to confirm feasibility. The work was divided between teammates based on User Stories.

## 2. API

The API was chosen based on project requirements and researching the best APIs to render search requests.
