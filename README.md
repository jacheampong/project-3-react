## 7. Compliance to MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Requirement ðŸ”´ 

### 7.1 Base Requirement

* A GitHub repo with your React app **Status: Complete**
* You must use React and leverage the API in the above requirements. **Status: Complete**
* You must communicate with the API and render the UI accordingly with the information received (using axios). **Status: Complete**
* Review the Rubric for the specifics of how your project will be graded. **Status: <=== TBD ===>**

### 7.2 Collaboration
* Every team member must have roughly the same number of individual commits in the commit history for your app (dividing responsibilities between different parts of the app is fine, but every team member must have commits in the project). **The team worked very well by dividing and synchronizing the available work as chunks**
* Every team must follow a Git Workflow **leveraging the GIT branches - main, track, artist, album and lyric and finally merging them effiiciently** 

### 7.3 Deployment
Your React app must be deployed to Heroku, GitHub Pages, or Surge. Applications that are not deployed will be considered incomplete. **Our application was deployed to production using Heroku**

## 8. Unsolved Issues and Future Enhancements

**<=== ? ===>**

Maybe Albums
Third Party API to render images of the artists
